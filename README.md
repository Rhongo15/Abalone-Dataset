# Abalone-Dataset
Building a model to predict the age of abalones

The aim was to build a regression model on the dataset. Because the dataset did not satisfy any of the assumptions of Linear Regression, Non-Linear Regression models were used to build a model. 

The dataset was heavily heteroscedastic and not normally distributed. Models like SVM and Weighted OLS were not tried out in this notebook.
